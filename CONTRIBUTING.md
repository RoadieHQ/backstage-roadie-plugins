# Contributing to the Roadie plugins for Backstage

We want to create strong community of contributors -- all working together to create the kind of delightful experience that Backstage deserves.

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. ‚ù§Ô∏è

In general, we aim to stick as closely as possible to the [contribution guidelines which apply to the Backstage project](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). If something is not covered in this document, please assume that the appropriate Backstage guideline will apply. 

## Types of Contributions

This repository will gather the plugins we have worked on, so contribution is more than welcome both in this repository, and in a scope of a particular plugin.

### Report bugs

No one likes bugs. Report bugs as an issue [here](https://github.com/RoadieHQ/roadie-backstage-plugins/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_template.md).

### Fix bugs or build new features

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs or problems that other users are having. If you're having a problem yourself, feel free to contribute a fix for us to review.

### Add e2e test to monorepo

We would like to prevent all the bugs from happening, but it is impossible. However, we can build strong e2e test which will make sure we are well aware of the problems and functionalities keep on working as expected. As we integrate more and more plugins, more and more tests will be needed. Contribute by writing some following guidelines in [E2E Tests](https://github.com/RoadieHQ/roadie-backstage-plugins/blob/main/E2E.md).

### Submit feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file [an issue](https://github.com/RoadieHQ/roadie-backstage-plugins/issues/new).

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Explain the wider context about what you are trying to achieve.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

### Add your company to ADOPTERS

## Coding Guidelines

We use the backstage-cli to build, serve, lint, test and package all the plugins.

As such, the [same coding guidelines mostly apply](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-guidelines).

## Merging to main

Plugins are automatically published when a version bump is merged to the `main` branch. Please include version bumps with your pull requests if you would like them to be released.
