This repo contains the Backstage plugins we, at Roadie, create and maintain. These plugins are published and you can look them up on [npmjs](https://npmjs.com).


## Getting Started

To get up and running with this repository, you will need to clone it off of GitHub and run an initial build.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoadieHQ/roadie-backstage-plugins.git
cd roadie-backstage-plugins
```

## Fetch dependencies and run an initial build from root directory

```bash
yarn install
yarn tsc
yarn build
```

You will be able to see plugins which are already integrated and installed in package.json inside

```bash
cd packages/app
```

folder.


Inside this repository you can add other plugins by running 

```bash
// packages/app
yarn add <<plugin>>
```

followed by 

```bash

## Structure of the repository.

This repository is a place where all of the RoadieHQ plugins we are developed are integrated under `/plugins` folder. They may be uses and/or modified by following steps below:
 
### Plugins container

Navigate to 

```bash
cd roadie-backstage-plugin/plugins
cd selected-plugin
```

Plugin folders consist separate unit tests per every plugin, while general e2e tests are written under 

```bash
cd roadie-backstage-plugin/packages/app/cypress/integration
```
folder.

### Sample service

In order to make E2E testing isolated from real entities, we have created `test-entity.yaml` under `packages/entitites`, which will be shown as sample-service entity when you start the app. This is used only for testing purposes and can be modified accordingly.

```bash
cd roadie-backstage-plugin/plugins
cd selected-plugin
```

Plugin folders consist of separate unit tests for each plugin, while general E2E tests are written under 

```bash
cd roadie-backstage-plugin/packages/app/cypress/integration
```
folder.
